### Links

### My process
To recreate the web page, at least, as similar as possible, I had to review content that I had already read, especially with flexbox, because when I added something to another part of the page, another part would not fit. I feel that it helped me a lot to think about the general structure of the page and then to do it part by part, that as a small reflection
